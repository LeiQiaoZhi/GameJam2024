[Design document ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/136IRZKv9wb0q7B8aOlj7eDH7Gq975HSldpHTbzk2kHI/edit)

## Collaboration

Everyone should mostly work in separte scenes. I have created a scene for everyone of us, e.g. `_Scenes/Workspace_Andy`.

If someone finshed work on a component (e.g. the character controller), he can make the corresponding gameobject a prefab, and others can drag it into their scenes.

## Input Handling

See `_Scripts/InputController` and the `Input Controller` gameobject. 

I have provided skeleton code for `CameraController` and `CharacterController` classes.
